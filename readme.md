Hi, this is a repository to put all the Steam depot manifests from games in the Portal series in a chronological order, to make it easier to see how games in the series have changed over time with updates.
Note: The Steam2 Manifest files don't include a field for a timestamp, so I've been forced to stick them in the first 11 commits with arbitrary, useless timestamps and make the assumption that the version numbers for all the depots line up. An assumption that's almost certainly false, but I don't have any current evidence to fix it. They're also presented in the plaintext directory manifest format created by HDiff. A format which will be switched out for DepotDownloader's interpretation of the manifests when I start loading in SteamPipe.

The Steam2 Depot names, for your reference:

401 portal content
402 portal french
403 portal german
404 portal russian
405 portal english
406 portal spanish
411 portal the first slice
